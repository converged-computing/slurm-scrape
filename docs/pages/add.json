We recommend using a git branch for this purpose.\nAdd your new file to the git repository.\nModify the \"Makefile.am\" file in the file's parent directory.\nExecute \"autoreconf\" in Slurm's top level directory.\nIf you have older versions of the autoconf, automake, libtool or aclocal then\nyou may need to manually modify the Makefile.in file in the file's parent\ndirectory. If you have different versions of the files than were originally\nused by the Slurm team, this may rebuild all of the Makefile.in files in Slurm.\nAdding a Plugin to Slurm\n\nThis is the procedure to follow in order to add a new plugin to the Slurm\ncode base.  We recommend using a git branch for this purpose. In this example,\nwe show which files would need to be modified in order to add a plugin named\n\"topology/4d_torus\".\nCreate a new directory for this plugin\n(e.g. \"src/plugins/topology/4d_torus\").\nAdd this new directory to its parent directory's \"Makefile.am\" file\n(e.g. \"src/plugins/topology/Makefile.am\").\nPut your new file(s) in the appropriate directory\n(e.g. \"src/plugins/topology/4d_torus/topology_4d_torus.c\"). \nCreate a \"Makefile.am\" file in the new directory identifying the new file(s)\n(e.g. \"src/plugins/topology/4d_torus/Makefile.am\"). Use an existing \"Makefile.am\"\nfile as a model.\nIdentify the new Makefile to be built at Slurm configure time in the file\n\"configure.ac\". Please maintain the alphabetic ordering of entries.\nExecute \"autoreconf\" in Slurm's top level directory.\nIf you have older versions of the autoconf, automake, libtool or aclocal then\nyou may need to manually create or modify the Makefile.in files.\nIf you have different versions of the files than were originally used by the\nSlurm team, this may rebuild all of the Makefile.in files in Slurm.\nModify the \"slurm.spec\" file to include the new plugin file in an\nappropriate RPM.\nAdd the new files, including \"Makefile.am\" and \"Makefile.in\", to the git\nrepository.\nLast modified 27 February 2019"

            "content": "Each job in the Slurm system has a state assigned to it. How the job state is\ndisplayed depends on the method used to identify the state.OverviewIn the Slurm code, there are base states and state flags.\nEach job has a base state and may have additional state flags set. When using\nthe REST API, both the base state and current\nflag(s) will be returned.When the squeue and sacct\ncommand report a job state, they represent it as a single state. Both will\nrecognize all base states but not all state flags. If a recognized flag is\npresent, it will be reported instead of the base state. Refer to the relevant\ncommand documentation for details.This page represents all job codes and flags that are represented in the\ncode. The names provided are the string representations that are used in\nuser-facing output. For most, the names used in the code are identical, with\nJOB_ at the start.\nFor more visibility into the job states and flags, set\nDebugFlags=TraceJobs and SlurmctldDebug=verbose\n(or higher) in slurm.conf.Job statesEach job known to the system will have one of the following states:\n\nNameDescription\nBOOT_FAILterminated due to node boot failure\nCANCELLEDcancelled by user or administrator\nCOMPLETEDcompleted execution successfully;\n\tfinished with an exit code of zero on all nodes\nDEADLINEterminated due to reaching the latest\n\tacceptable start time specified for the job\nFAILEDcompleted execution unsuccessfully;\n\tnon-zero exit code or other failure condition\nNODE_FAILterminated due to node failure\nOUT_OF_MEMORYexperienced out of memory error\nPENDINGqueued and waiting for initiation;\n\twill typically have a reason code\n\tspecifying why it has not yet started\nPREEMPTEDterminated due to\n\tpreemption; may transition to another state\n\tbased on the configured PreemptMode and job characteristics\nRUNNINGallocated resources and executing\nSUSPENDEDallocated resources but execution\n\tsuspended, such as from preemption or a\n\tdirect request from an\n\tauthorized user\nTIMEOUTterminated due to reaching the time limit,\n\tsuch as those configured in slurm.conf or\n\tspecified for the individual job\n\nJob flagsJobs may have additional flags set:\n\nNameDescription\nCOMPLETINGjob has finished or been cancelled\n\tand is performing cleanup tasks, including the\n\tepilog script if present\nCONFIGURINGjob has been allocated nodes and is\n\twaiting for them to boot or reboot\nLAUNCH_FAILEDfailed to launch on the chosen\n\tnode(s); includes prolog failure and\n\tother failure conditions\nPOWER_UP_NODEjob has been allocated powered down\n\tnodes and is waiting for them to boot\nRECONFIG_FAILnode configuration for job failed\nREQUEUEDjob is being requeued,\n\tsuch as from preemption or a\n\tdirect request from an\n\tauthorized user\nREQUEUE_FEDrequeued due to conditions of its\n\tsibling job in a federated setup\nREQUEUE_HOLDsame as REQUEUED but will\n\tnot be considered for scheduling until it is\n\treleased\nRESIZINGthe size of the job is changing; prevents\n\tconflicting job changes from taking place\nRESV_DEL_HOLDheld due to deleted reservation\nREVOKEDrevoked due to conditions of its sibling\n\tjob in a federated setup\nSIGNALINGoutgoing signal to job is pending\nSPECIAL_EXITsame as REQUEUE_HOLD but\n\tused to identify a special situation\n\tthat applies to this job\nSTAGE_OUTstaging out data\n\t(burst buffer)\nSTOPPEDreceived SIGSTOP to suspend the job without\n\treleasing resources\nUPDATE_DBsending an update about the job to the\n\tdatabase\n\nLast modified 01 October 2024"
